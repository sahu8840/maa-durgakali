          मां दुर्गाकाली शक्तिपीठ has a rich history that evolved with the creation of the universe itself. The reflection of Goddess Durgakali was revealed in the form of Divya Jyoti to her beloved devotee, Darbarji Swami Suryanand, during Navratri. Accordingly, the chosen site became the abode of Maa Durgakali in Ayodhya.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The temple structure of Maa Durgakali took its form and design as guided by divine morder, without the use of technical support from engineers or architects. Every dimension of the structure was sketched by the Mother herself, revealing its shape and form to her devotee, Swami Suryanand.

          The temple has been a witness to countless spiritual gatherings, divine manifestations, and miraculous events that have strengthened the faith of devotees.
